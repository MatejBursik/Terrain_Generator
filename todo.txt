TODO:
    - figure out how to implement first person and switching between the two states
    - figure out 3D models
        *- draw the 3d model in the center of the plain (spaceship flying in the middle of the plain)
        - animate the ship rotating depending on player direction
        - when switching to first person, animate the ship landing
Rework:
    - README.md

Fix:
    - issue with terrain shader not working on different plain sizes other than 10x10
