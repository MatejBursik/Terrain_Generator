TODO:
    - make concept art
    - figure out how to implement first person and switching between the two states
    - figure out how to load a 3D model
        - draw the 3d model in the center of the plain (spaceship flying in the middle of the plain)
        - when switching to first person, animate the ship landing
Rework:
    - README.md

Fix:
    - workflow: exe is missing resources directory
    - out of bounds: max Y border check is failing but not the max X (issue probably in generate_mesh())
